# CTGAN + XGBoost Intrusion Detection System

This project implements a real-time intrusion detection system using
CTGAN-based synthetic data generation and an XGBoost classifier.

## Features
- Handles class imbalance using CTGAN
- Multi-class intrusion detection
- SHAP-based explainability
- Gradio interface for real-time inference
